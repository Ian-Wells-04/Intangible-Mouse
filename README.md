# Intangible-Mouse
Goal: To Create

Required Items:
1. Arduino Uno R4 WIFI
2. LIS3DH Triple-Axis Accelerometer (any accelerometer should work but code and wiring will be a bit different)
3. JST PH 4-Pin to Male Header Cable - I2C (Other I2C cables theoretically should work, but this is the only one that worked for me for some reason)
4. Cord to connect Arduino to device ( there is many ways)
5. Surface To attatch sensor to (I just use a piece of cardboard)
6. NanoEdge (Website to train AI and make a Libary its free)
7. Arduino IDE 1.8
8. Install all the Libaries that are included in the code
9. Install Libary for the Specific Arduino (make sure it's the uno r4 wifi, just uno r4, or a similar one will not work)
